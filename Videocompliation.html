        <p>A montage of some of my favorite anime</p>

            <h2>Luffy</h2>
            <p>Luffy is the fearless and fun-loving captain of the Straw Hat Pirates. His dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary One Piece treasure. After eating the Gum-Gum Fruit, his body gained rubber-like properties, making him immune to most blunt attacks and giving him creative combat abilities. Luffy is known for his strong sense of justice, loyalty to his crew, and never backing down from a fight — even against impossible odds.</p>

            <h2>Eren Yeager</h2>
            <p>Eren begins as a passionate and impulsive youth determined to destroy all Titans after witnessing his mother's death. Over time, he evolves into a complex and morally gray character, shouldering the burden of humanity's survival. As the holder of the Attack Titan (and later, other Titans), he possesses immense power and seeks freedom at all costs — even if it means making devastating choices. His journey challenges the ideas of justice, revenge, and what it means to be truly free.</p>

            <h2>Sung Jinwoo</h2>
            <p>Originally a weak hunter barely surviving in dungeons, Jin-Woo becomes the world's most powerful being after gaining the ability to level up endlessly — a unique power called the "Player" system. Calm, intelligent, and ruthless in battle, he commands a shadow army and grows stronger with each fight. His transformation from underdog to unbeatable warrior is central to the story, and he carries a quiet but intense resolve to protect others.</p>
