    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup lower-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup bourbon</li>
      <li>¼ cup unsweetened apple juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon pure maple syrup</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch-thick strips</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch, plus 1 teaspoon, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola or avocado</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
      <li>3 cups cooked brown rice</li>
      <li>Sliced scallions, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine soy sauce, bourbon, apple juice, vinegar, maple syrup, garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>Toss together chicken and 1 tablespoon cornstarch in a large bowl. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken; cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the soy-bourbon mixture; stir to coat. Cook, stirring often, until the sauce has reduced to a syrupy consistency and the chicken is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. </li>
      <li>Combine water and the remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch in a small bowl; stir to mix well. Add to the pan; cook, stirring often, until the sauce thickens and coats the chicken, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Divide rice among 4 plates; top with the chicken and sauce. Garnish with scallions, if desired.</li>
